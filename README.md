## Steps to deploy
0. Obtain legal license code of Farming Simulator 22
1. On [Giant's download page](https://eshop.giants-software.com/downloads.php), enter the license code and download FS22 image (FarmingSimulator2022ESD.img)
2. Unpack the downloaded image and move contents to desired folder on host
3. Look at the docker run template and make changes that fit your needs [^1]
5. After that, run the docker image
6. [Download VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/) and connect to automatically created VNC server with `host_ip:5900`
7. Grant owner permissions to /opt/fs22 by using `sudo chown -R username:username /opt/fs22` (replace `username` with actual username)[^2]
8. In the home folder, run setup.sh (usually by using `bash ./setup.sh`)
9. If installation was successful, start the actual server by using `bash ./fs22start.sh`[^3]
10. Now, access the Web UI on `host_ip:8080`

[^1]: Set the `USERID` variable to User ID that will run the docker container. Change the binded folder to folder where you have installation image unpacked
[^2]: Default root password is "ubuntu"
[^3]: If the error window appear that you need to install latest graphics drivers, just click "No" and ignore it
